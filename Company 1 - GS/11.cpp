Que-
Given an unsorted array Arr of size N of positive integers. One number 'A' from set 
{1, 2, â€¦N} is missing and one number 'B' occurs twice in array. Find these two numbers.


// marking visited elements as negative as all elements are positive
// as there is a repetition an element will be negative already as marked by prev same element
// we got the rep. ele, now for the missing no, the element at its index will be positive as we
// never visite that index.
